# TodoList-useMemo

In this project we will explore the use of
the useMemo hook in a React application to
optimize performance. We will focus on a
Todo List app as our example, where we will
implement useMemo to prevent unnecessary
re-rendering of components. This project
assumes a basic understanding of React and hooks.

Step 1: Setting up the Project

-  Create a new React project using your
preferred setup (e.g., Create React App).
-  Install any necessary dependencies
(such as react and react-dom).

Step 2: Create a Todo List Component

-  Create a new component called TodoList.
-  Implement the basic structure of a todo list,
including an input field to add new todos
and a list to display existing todos.
-  Initially, hardcode a few todos for testing purposes.

Step 3: Implement Adding Todos

-  Add functionality to the input
field to allow users to add new todos.
-  When a new todo is added, update the
component state to include the new todo.

Step 4: Displaying Todos

-  Iterate through the list of todos and
render them in the todo list component.
-  Use the map function to create individual todo items.

Step 5: Optimizing with useMemo

-  Import the useMemo hook from React.
-  Identify any computationally expensive
operations within the component that
are not dependent on changing state or props.
-  Wrap these operations using the
useMemo hook to memoize their values.
-  Test the app and observe any performance improvements.

Step 6: Testing Performance

-  Compare the performance of the app
before and after implementing useMemo.
-  Use browser tools (such as Chrome DevTools)
to measure the rendering time and identify
any significant improvements.

Step 7: Updating Todos

-  Implement functionality to mark todos
as completed or delete them from the list.
-  Observe the behavior of the component and
check if unnecessary re-renders occur.
-  If necessary, apply useMemo to optimize any
computationally expensive operations
related to updating todos.

Step 8: Additional Optimizations (Optional)

-  Explore other potential optimizations
within your Todo List app.
-  Consider using other hooks like useCallback
or useRef to optimize specific areas,
such as event handlers or DOM manipulation.

Step 9: Testing and Refactoring

-  Thoroughly test your app to ensure its
functionality remains intact after
implementing optimizations.
-  Refactor your code as needed to
improve readability and maintainability.
